# BabyPanda

Project for course Abstract Programming @ Jagiellonian University

BabyPanda is a C++ implementation of simplified Pandas-like library. The goal of the project was to implement a lightweight yet functional library that supports basic operations for data analysis and manipulation. The library was implemented using several abstract programming techniques from C++.

## Key Features  
- **Easy-to-use interface** – BabyPanda allows intuitive and readable operations on tabular data.  
- **Core DataFrame operations** – filtering, grouping, sorting, loading, and saving data.   
- **Lightweight and dependency-free** – designed to be minimalistic and easily integrable into C++ projects.  

## Implementation Details  
- **Templates and generic programming** – to support flexible data handling.   
- **Operator overloading** – to provide an intuitive way of interacting with data structures.  
- **STL integration** – making use of standard containers and algorithms for performance optimization.
- **Concepts** - used to enforce type safety and prevent invalid operations at compile time.
